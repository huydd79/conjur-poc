# Sample code for Conjur integration
This folder contains some sample code that you can use for your applications incase you want to send request to conjur to retrive secrets directly. Those sample codes are written on several languages for your reference.
Each sample code will have two authentication use cases:
- Authentication using API key: using this method, your application will need to have information of userID/hostID and API key to authenticate with conjur
- Authentication using JWT: this method is using jwt for conjur authentication. Your application will need to have jwt file which is generated by application platform for authentication. If you are running application on standalone platform without jwt, you can refer to my jwtgen project for the tool to generate jwt token for standalone application/container at below links:
