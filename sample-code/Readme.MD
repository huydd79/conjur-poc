# Sample code for Conjur integration
This folder contains some sample code that you can use for your applications incase you want to send request to conjur to retrive secrets directly. Those sample codes are written on several languages for your reference.
Each sample code will have two authentication use cases:
- Authentication using API key: using this method, your application will need to have information of userID/hostID and API key to authenticate with conjur
- Authentication using JWT: this method is using jwt for conjur authentication. Your application will need to have jwt file which is generated by application platform for authentication. If you are running application on standalone platform without jwt, you can refer to my jwtgen project for the tool to generate jwt token for standalone application/container at below links:

## C# sample codes
- test_conjur_authn_apikey.cs
- test_conjur_authn_jwt.cs
These are sample code for testing on your MS Visual Studio project. Sample codes are using RestSharp package for sending HTTPS request to conjur. You will need to install RestSharp for your project. (Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Package for your solution > Browse)

## NodeJS sample codes
- test_conjur_authn_apikey.js
- test_conjur_authn_jwt.js

The NodeJS sample codes are using request package to send REST request. To run this sample code, you need to install request package before run

```npm install request```

Sample code can be run using below command:

```node <sample_code_file.js> ```

## Python sample codes
- test_conjur_authn_apikey.py
- test_conjur_authn_jwt.py
These sample codes are using python http.client library for sending REST request.
